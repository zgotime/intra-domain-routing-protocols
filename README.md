##Introduction

In this project, a variant of the distance vector routing protocol (DV) and a variant of the link-state routing protocol (LS) are implemented. A GSR9999 simulator written in C++ is used to test the two routing protocols.

##Implementation
In our project, in order to reduce the complexity of class RoutingProtocolImpl, we abstract LS and DV protocol to class LSTable and class DVTable. In each class, it maintains their own data structure, which implemented by hash_map, to store all necessary information such as all other nodesâ€™ link states or routing information. The final routing table is placed in class RoutingProtocolImpl which can be updated by either class LSTable or class DVTable.
